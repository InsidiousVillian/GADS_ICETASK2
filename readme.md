Decoy Portal Feature
Overview

Dynamic arena feature introducing risk/reward mechanics. Players entering the portal may be sent back to the start of the round (penalty) or receive a temporary shield buff (reward) that lasts until colliding with an obstacle, which is then destroyed. Encourages strategic decision-making and adds tension to arena gameplay.

How to Play

Approach a Decoy Portal carefully – it may:

Teleport you back to the start of the round.

Grant a shield buff until you hit an obstacle.

Use the shield buff strategically to pass through obstacles safely.

Visual and audio cues indicate shield activation and loss.

Run

Integrate the DecoyPortal object in the arena scene.

Portals can be randomized or manually assigned for teleport/shield effects.

Shield interactions rely on obstacle collision detection for proper behavior.
