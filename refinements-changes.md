## Decoy Portal Refinements (Updated)

**Change Log:**  
- Added new shield buff effect to Decoy Portal.  
- Shield lasts until the player hits an obstacle; the obstacle is destroyed, and the shield disappears.  
- Added visual and audio cues for activation and deactivation.  
- Maintained existing teleport-to-start functionality.  
- Updated portal design to allow randomized or preset effects.  
- Tested for multiple obstacle interactions and confirmed consistent behavior.
