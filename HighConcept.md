## Title
Controls Not Included

## Genre
Experimental Puzzle / Comedy

## Core Loop
Player navigates a test chamber. During play, game rules change unexpectedly (controls, gravity, door behavior). Player must adapt quickly.

## Visual Style
Minimalist 2D/3D simulation — white rooms, geometric shapes, glowing doors, glitchy UI prompts.

## Intended Experience
Player feels confusion, surprise, and amusement as they adapt. Goal: provoke repeated reactions of "Uhm… nope… what?"

## Unique Hook
The game teaches a rule, then breaks it deliberately.

## Target Platform
Browser (desktop)

## Theme Interpretation
Mechanics actively subvert expectations to embody the theme "Uhm, nope, what."
